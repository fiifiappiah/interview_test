1. Reverse a string

2. Reverse a sentence ("ed likes chicken" -> "chicken likes ed")

3. Given the following list of words sort them by internal alphabetical order and then sort the entire list based on that (i.e. "hello" becomes "ehllo", "number" becomes "bemnru")
  a. clearance
  b. memorize
  c. probability
  d. stress

4. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

5. Find the minimum value in an array of numbers

6. Find the maximum value in an array of numbers

7. Calculate a remainder (given a numerator and denominator)

8. Return distinct values from a list including duplicates (i.e. "1 3 5 3 7 3 1 1 5" -> "1 3 5 7")

9. Return distinct values and their counts (i.e. the list above becomes "1(3) 3(3) 5(2) 7(1)")

10. Write an implementation of a factorial function which uses recursion. (i.e. factorial(7) -> 5040)
Given a string of expressions (only variables, +, and -, ignore whitespace) and a set of variable/value pairs (i.e. a=1, b=7, c=3, d=14) return the result of the expression ("a + b+c -d" would be -3). Mega Bonus points given to answers that don't use Eval.
